# mechbot version 2

# About
 - mechbot is an IRC bot and was my first major project in python and was pretty much abandoned until 8/01/2020 when I started work again.
 - For now all he does is connect and respond to his name. He is receiving a major overhaul as I have more knowledge of python now.

# Requirements
 - yaml (for now)

# Install
 - Clone the repo, make sure yaml is installed in your environment

# How to run
 - Fill in all the required info in bot_config.yaml
 - launch mechbot.py (works with python3, might work with python2. I didn't actually check at all)
